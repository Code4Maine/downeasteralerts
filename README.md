A collection of web resources with relevant updates for riders on the Amtrak Downeaster

**Unofficial Status Maps and Alerts**

[Amtrak Status Maps](http://www.dixielandsoftware.net/Amtrak/status/StatusMaps/) The most reliable collection of real-time Amtrak train locations is a free web service. The Downeaster status can be retreived from the [Northeast Region map](http://www.dixielandsoftware.net/cgi-bin/getmap.pl?mapname=Northeast)

[ASM Alerts](http://www.dixielandsoftware.net/Amtrak/alerts/) is a web service allowing for customizable train status updates to be sent via SMS/EMail.  The service can only retrieve alerts as they are happening however and cannot serve to warn in advance.

**MBTA Sources**

The Downeaster shares trackage with the MBTA Commuter Rail on portions of the [Lowell](http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=LOWELL#servicealerts) and [Haverhill](http://www.mbta.com/schedules_and_maps/rail/lines/?route=HAVRHILL#servicealerts) Lines.  If either of these lines are impacted by service delays, it is likely to affect the Downeaster as well.  Therefore the following resources provided by the MBTA and MassDOT will be useful.

[T Alerts](http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/t_alerts/) is a service that can be configured to send service alerts specific to the Lowell and Haverhill lines via email or SMS

The following URL also lists commuter rail service advisories as they occur- http://www.mbta.com/rider_tools/transit_updates/

The [MBTA GTFS-Realtime Feed](http://realtime.mbta.com/portal) includes the most updated information affecting MBTA services, including Commuter Rail.
