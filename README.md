In most metro regions of the U.S, transit operations are often structured around a single service type. So "Commuter Rail" services are designed to masses of 9-5 professionals one way in the morning and ack again in the afternoon, while "Intercity" rail is meant to connect from one dense urban center to another (see [table of transit service design](https://github.com/Code4Maine/transitservicedesign/blob/master/README.md) for a detailed outline of service types and their relevant data sets).  Of course, there are no rules preventing travelers from say traveling between NYC and Philadelphia via NJTransit and SEPTA Commuter trains, but because the service was structured for a different purpose then the one they are using it for, they will find in conflict with everything from the way the information is displayed to the ticketing policies.
